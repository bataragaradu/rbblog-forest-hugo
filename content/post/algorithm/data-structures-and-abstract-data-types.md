### Lets have a general idea about abstract data types and data structures.

It's easy to forget when you're not diving everyday in a new algorithm problem that data structures aren't the same thing as Abstract data types. For me, when I hear abstract data types I'm immediately teleported back in my old college years in a course bench while trying to draw an array copy or instantiating a new heap, all of this while the dangerous mathematical symbols  where getting displayed on the teachers tableboard.

### Abstract Data types

We can see abstract data types as the set of operations that are not dependent on their implementation and neither of the object types. We can see them from the users point of view.

Usually the abstract data types are represented mathematical, but we we can give a short overview for the most common of them without getting into details.
