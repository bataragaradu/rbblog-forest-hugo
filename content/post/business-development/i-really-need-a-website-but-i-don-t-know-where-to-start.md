Should it be that complicated? If you don't start investigating, yes. But if you give it a try, you'll see that a proof of concept is not mission impossible. Also, if you have mindset that's open for scalability, that's a perfect start.

The secret word for websites is _depends_.  
The target of the business, perspective, functionality, budged.

Websites can be divided in:

* Static content generated websites
* Server rendered websites
* Front end websites that integrate with backend servers

Development steps:

1. Choose a dns provider and a dns name (porkbun.com, goddaddy.com etc.) This will imply annual costs for your bussines.domain.
2. The second natural choice would be where your application/website gets deployed and how much traffic that site could get. This implies to choose a host provider.  
   There are 3 main types of hosting your server/application:
   1. a web hosting provider that is renting phisical servers,
   2. Cloud providers
   3. Your corporation will manage its own onprem. Having dedicated servers and people that will handle networking.

      Renting phisical servers:
      1. shared hosting - where you are sharing the server with different other people
      2. vps hosting - It's also a shared hosting but a virtualized server is on top of it - so you know for certain the allocated memory, CPU usage and space
      3. Dedicated hosting -having your dedicated web server
      4. Managed is a managed and optimized hosting that is targeting certain types of websites like Wordpress

      2. Microsoft Azure
      3. Google Cloud Platform
      4. Alibaba Cloud
